  <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    content="A web application for college students to keep track of the majors, ges, pes, and electives they need to take throughout their college life. Users can create their own curriculum within the app and they can also share it with other users. They can mark each subject as “Taken”, “Taking”, or “Have Not Taken”. The application can also compute the GWA needed for the remaining semesters to achieve a latin honor." />
